# Crunch 
>>Documentation

Problem Statement: Predicting project value to know if
it will be profitable or worth undertaking before
resources are committed.
Solution: The solution will be a web-based application
that accepts inputs from users to output whether their
project is valuable or not. This application is dubbed
Crunch.

>Functional Requirements:

• Users should input the figures for the main
project costs and cash inflows onto the system.

• System should use in built equations (including
Payback Period, Discounted Payback Period,
Net Present Value and Profitability Index) to
compute whether the project is profitable or
not.

• Users should be able to see whether their
project is profitable or not.

• Users should be given recommendations on
how to increase the profitability of their project
if the system deems it not profitable.

• Users should be able to see the explanation
behind the ranking of their project.

>Non-functional Requirements:

• Performance and scalability: The system should
be fast with returning results even with a
higher workload.

• Reliability, availability, maintainability: The
system should have little or no system failures.

• Usability: The system should be easy for a
customer to use.

>> Parameters required
1. Project Name
2. Project Industry
3. Project Description
4. Project status (On going or yet to begin)
5. Project duration (Start date and end date)
6. Cash inflow ( Expected Income)
7. Cash outflow ( Expected Costs for each unit
8. Currency

>> Outputs

1. Needed Capital
2. Payback Period
3. Net present value
4. Profitability index

Use case diagram can be found in Crunch storyboard.pdf

>> Description

The user opens up the crunch system, a free service on theprojectvalue.com, inputs the requested parameters.
The system takes in the input and calculates the required output and stores it as well as the parameters into an archive for reference or if needed, further processing
