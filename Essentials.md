# Crunch 
>>Documentation

Problem Statement: Predicting project value to know if
it will be profitable or worth undertaking before
resources are committed.
Solution: The solution will be a web-based application
that accepts inputs from users to output whether their
project is valuable or not. This application is dubbed
Crunch.

>Functional Requirements:

• Users should input the figures for the main
project costs and cash inflows onto the system.

• System should use in built equations (including
Payback Period, Discounted Payback Period,
Net Present Value and Profitability Index) to
compute whether the project is profitable or
not.

• Users should be able to see whether their
project is profitable or not.

• Users should be given recommendations on
how to increase the profitability of their project
if the system deems it not profitable.

• Users should be able to see the explanation
behind the ranking of their project.

>Non-functional Requirements:

• Performance and scalability: The system should
be fast with returning results even with a
higher workload.

• Reliability, availability, maintainability: The
system should have little or no system failures.

• Usability: The system should be easy for a
customer to use.

>> Parameters required
1. Project Name
2. Project Industry
3. Project Description
4. Project status (On going or yet to begin)
5. Project duration (Start date and end date)
6. Cash inflow ( Expected Income)
7. Cash outflow ( Expected Costs for each unit
8. Currency

>> Outputs

1. Needed Capital
2. Payback Period
3. Net present value
4. Profitability index

Use case diagram can be found in Crunch storyboard.pdf

>> Description

The user opens up the crunch system, a free service on theprojectvalue.com, inputs the requested parameters.
The system takes in the input and calculates the required output and stores it as well as the parameters into an archive for reference or if needed, further processing

>> Research and user feedback

Research question

Predicting project value and knowing if it's profitable or worth undertaking before resources are committed

our solution, a project valuation application


Research methodology (who you spoke with and how, the number of people, etc)

We used online survey (Yesu and Nanan) getting X replies since our target users for the app will need to be tech savy anyway and do not have time for one on one interviews 

- Top 3 key findings from interviews

1. The system should provide basic features for free but also offer extended services which allows for detailed graphs and projections for extensive users.
2. The system should provide security of user information so no one steels the details or ideas of others
3. The system should be fast without putting a significant stress on pc resources. 


After the testing, we got feedback on adapting it to enable users to keep track of the project as it is on going as well and not only in the predicting phase, giving them a means by which they can compare physical values to projections and track growth


- How the research has changed (focused) their problem i.e. what will you be designing for.
Research has given us 

The research has shown as that very few people have experience with such services or applications, so we should focus on a simple yet easily understandable implement which automates as work as possible
